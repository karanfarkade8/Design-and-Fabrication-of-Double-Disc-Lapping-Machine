# Design-and-Fabrication-of-Double-Disc-Lapping-Machine
Objective: Designed and fabricated a double disc lapping machine to simultaneously polish both sides of 
cylindrical parts, improving efficiency by 50% over traditional single-sided machines.
• Key Achievements:
• Developed a cost-effective and low-maintenance solution to reduce production time and increase 
precision for industrial lapping operations.
• Material Selection: Optimized the use of mild steel for durability and cost-effectiveness.
• Design and Fabrication: Successfully designed components like motor drive, belt, shafts, and polishing 
wheels to handle dual-sided operations with minimal misalignment.
• Technical Specifications: Incorporated an 8600 RPM induction motor, variable speed drive, and 
friction-based polishing wheels.
• Cost Analysis: Reduced overall project cost by 30% through efficient material and process selection.
• Applications: Used for surface finishing in ball bearings, engine valves, and precision gears.
